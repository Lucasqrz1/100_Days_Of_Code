# Tip Calculator

This is a simple Python script from Day 2 of my 100 Days of Code challenge.

## What it does

The script asks the user for:

- The total bill amount
- The desired tip percentage
- The number of people splitting the bill

It then calculates how much each person should pay, including their share of the tip.

## How to run

Make sure Python is installed on your system.

Run the script with:

```bash
python code.py
