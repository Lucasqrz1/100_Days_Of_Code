🧠 Objectives

Load and inspect programming language popularity data.

Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.

Visualize the usage trends of different languages over time.

Compare specific languages (e.g., Python vs JavaScript).

Identify shifts in developer preferences.


🛠️ Technologies Used

Python

pandas

matplotlib

Jupyter Notebook


📈 Key Insights

The dataset includes yearly usage percentages for several programming languages.

Python shows a clear and consistent growth trend.

Java and C++ have relatively stable or declining popularity.

Data visualization techniques like line plots help reveal trends clearly over time.


🚀 How to Use

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Lucasqrz1/100_days_of_code.git
cd 100_days_of_code/Day_73

Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook Programming_Languages_(start).ipynb

Run each cell to:

Load and clean the dataset.

Visualize trends across languages.

Compare languages using filtering and plotting.


📌 Notes

Data source is likely derived from Stack Overflow or similar trend analysis platforms.

This notebook serves as an introductory EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) on programming language popularity.
